## AlpacaTradingAgent Package

### Implementation Details

Built with LangGraph for flexibility and modularity. The enhanced version integrates with multiple financial APIs and supports both paper and live trading through Alpaca. We recommend using `gpt-5-mini` for testing to minimize API costs, as the framework makes numerous API calls across all 5 agents.

### Python Usage

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

# Initialize with default config
ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy())

# Analyze a single stock
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2024-05-10")
print(decision)

# Analyze multiple assets including crypto
symbols = ["NVDA", "ETH/USD", "AAPL"]
for symbol in symbols:
    _, decision = ta.propagate(symbol, "2024-05-10")
    print(f"{symbol}: {decision}")
```

### Custom Configuration

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

# Create custom config for enhanced features
config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config["deep_think_llm"] = "gpt-5-mini"  # Cost-effective for testing
config["quick_think_llm"] = "gpt-5-mini"
config["max_debate_rounds"] = 2  # Increase debate rounds
config["online_tools"] = True  # Use real-time data
config["enable_margin_trading"] = True  # Allow short selling
config["auto_execute_trades"] = False  # Manual approval required

# Initialize with custom config
ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=config)

# Analyze with crypto support
_, decision = ta.propagate("BTC/USD", "2024-05-10")
print(decision)
```
